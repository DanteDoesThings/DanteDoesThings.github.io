<p align="center">&nbsp;Better formatting and look for mobile! also proper 
grammar in the blog and home (update log wont cause that's solidified into 
stone) along with everything being a bit more squished as to not have everything 
so far apart! also you can go back to the lodge easier! also the blog can and 
will be updated without the update log doing so! also better buttons as to have 
everything (that i at least consider to be important) that is important, bigger!<br>
